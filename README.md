# Ticket Reservation

A Java-based ticket reservation system for booking tickets to on-campus events such as musicals and sports games. This project demonstrates the use of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes in Java, along with formatted output for ticket booking details.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following classes within the `Solution` package:

- **`IBooking`**: An interface with the `CalculateBooking` method, which calculates the total price based on the number of tickets.
- **`Ticket`**: An abstract base class containing common attributes (`ticketNumber`, `eventName`, `eventLocation`, `eventDate`) and an abstract method for setting the event location.
- **`Musicals`**: A subclass of `Ticket` that implements `IBooking`. It includes a price calculation of R250 per ticket and an additional attribute `refreshmentsServed`.
- **`SportGame`**: A subclass of `Ticket` that implements `IBooking`. It includes a price calculation of R120 per ticket.
- **`useTickets`**: The driver class for testing the system, where instances of `Musicals` and `SportGame` are created, and booking details are printed with formatted currency output.
